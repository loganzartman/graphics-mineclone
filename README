Notes on required features:
If infinite world is a required feature, there are some physics issues in chunks with negative coordinates. Otherwise, all features are working as intended.
We ported our perlin noise generator to GLSL, and use it for water and clouds. Unfortunately, it is not very fast, so we use a cheaper coherent noise function borrowed from the internet for block texturing.

Optional features:
* Procedurally generated sky (by performing ray-plane intersection and sampling perlin noise)
* Many kinds of cubes
* Advanced water rendering
    * two-pass solution that renders background (non-water blocks) color and depth to texture and then composites water blocks on top
    * water gets more opaque as it is deeper
    * normals (and specular highlights) computed using perlin noise
    * screen-space refraction (fake refraction of things on screen) by using refracted ray to compute an offset when sampling the background texture during water rendering pass.
